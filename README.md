Hello!

To try out a demo, please put any of its dependencies (see below, Sources/Larger files needed) in the corresponding folders.<br>

All the pages refer to the dependencies using `../<folder>/<file>`, so please serve from the directory which has `_src`, `_blob` and the folder of the project you're running.

Sources needed: (in the `_src/` folder)<br>
`p5.js` for `ball-bounce-box`<br>
`p5.js` for `random-walker`<br>
`chart.js` for `js-fetch-csv`

Larger files needed: (in the `_blob/` folder)<br>
