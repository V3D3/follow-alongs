Hello!

To try out the demos, please put `p5.js` in the `_src/` folder.<br>
All the pages refer to `p5.js` using `../_src/p5.js`, so if serving please serve from the directory which has both `_src` and the folder of the project you're running.

Currently following:<br>
Daniel Shiffman's `The Coding Train`

Larger files needed: (in the `_blob/` folder)<br>
`example.jpg` for `js-fetch`
